CANNOT RELEASE NEXT VERSION WITHOUT THESE

	Fractional Defense:		Damage taken from fractional damage is Power * (160-stam)/128

	Rage:					Has stam-based chance of coming out of Rage 
								if Moogle Charm is equipped.
							Rage attacks may crit (natural crit rate, boosted by "critical rate up")
							
	Retort:					Balanced Retort discussed. Prolly increase Cover/Counter, self-heal, counters with Dispatch?
	
	Tools:					Autocrossbow's power is just straight 255, no Schematics

WOULD BE NICE, BUT NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED FOR RELEASE OF LOL NEW WORLD
						
	Back Guard:				Doesn't completely eliminate chances of a back / pincer attack.

	Heiji's Coin:			Cheats on Cover and Counter
	
UNDEVELOPED IDEAS

	Slots:					something, something, gains "Schematics" boost somewhere
							Really, just gains more slots later on?
							
	Duncan:					Gives Gauntlent effect to physical Blitzes instead of giving Bum Rush
							MY END would be setting Bum Rush to lvl.30 capstone, 210 power
							
	Tools:					Something, something, Schematics boosts magic tools
							Schematics hidden ... somewhere
