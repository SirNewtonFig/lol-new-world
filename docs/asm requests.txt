CANNOT RELEASE LOL NEW WORLD WITHOUT THESE

	Tiered Status Evade:	By Status, rather than by enemy
							Breakpoints I believe should be 72, 108, and 128
							72 breakpoint should be "must pass two checks" (hard test)

	Interceptor:			Block chance is stam/192
							Interceptor status on Memento Ring or something
							Relmception's attack goes to mag-based, 90 power (I'll handle this)
						
	Elemental Multiplier:	Stacks like normal multipliers, instead of being separate
							IF proves impossible:
								Consider a Morph nerf. Perhaps stamina's contribution to
								Morph defense is halved? I did consider such a thing as
								a balancing factor to auto-morph though
	
	Counter-attacks:		Vigor-based chance
	
	Runic:					May counter-attack after absorbing a spell

	Locke:					Only Locke may use stealable-only items.
								Slim Jim = Changed to just setting its statuses (Regen & Haste). Brawlers, Soldiers
								Snake Oil = Reduced to 1/4 heal. Merchants, Zozo
								Bio Bomb = Single-targets, sets Blind / Mute / Imp. Late WoB (ghost dudes)
								Bouncy Ball = Steal only. WoR
								Mystery Egg = Consumable, summons Palidor. WoR
							Humanoids only have Locke stealables, and only one Item to steal
							Steal formula has spd-based chance of success
								

WOULD BE NICE, BUT NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED FOR RELEASE OF LOL NEW WORLD
						
	Back Guard:				Doesn't completely eliminate chances of a back / pincer attack.

	Heiji's Coin:			Cheats on Cover and Counter
	
	Blitz:					Half-turn failure
	
	Duncan:					Gives Gauntlent effect to physical Blitzes instead of giving Bum Rush
							MY END would be setting Bum Rush to lvl.30 capstone, 210 power
					
	Tools:					Autocrossbow's power is just straight 255, no Schematics
							Something, something, Schematics boosts magic tools
							Schematics hidden ... somewhere

	Slots:					something, something, gains "Schematics" boost somewhere
							Really, just gains more slots later on?

	Dance:					Half-turn stumble, but base Dance success rate is lowered
							Fixing explanation text for each Dance in the Menu
								The Dance Steps are:
								(DANCE:			7/16		5/16		3/16		1/16)
								EARTH BLUES		Harvester	Razor Leaf	Moonlight	Raccoon
								FIRE WALTZ		Fireball	Elf Fire	Mirage		Meerkat
								WIND SONG		Mirage		Sun Bath	Wind Slash	Rabbit
								WATER RONDO		El Nino		Plasma		Surge		Toxic Frog
								
								RUIN LAMENT		Avalanche	Surge		Sirocco		Wild Boars
								LOVE REQUIEM	Sun Bath	Moonlight	Harvester	Cockatrice
								SOUL DIRGE		Bedevil		Elf Fire	Devour		Tapir
								DANCING MAD		Cadenza		Devour		Sirocco		Wombat
						
AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT, BUT WOULD BE A SEPARATE MOD FROM LOL NEW WORLD

	Rage:					Stamina modifies odds of each attack
							Probably an effect on Storm Belt / Blizzard Orb, rather then innate?
