CANNOT RELEASE NEXT VERSION WITHOUT THESE
	
	Bugs & Glitches:		Any glitch fixes
							
	Retort:					Balanced Retort discussed. ?Prolly increase Cover/Counter, self-heal, counters with Dispatch, or can DA?
	
	Tools:					Autocrossbow's power is just straight 255, no Schematics
	
	??Utility Belt??		Half-turn Item on new Relic: Utility Belt. (Mog and Gau have it?)
							Also, re-consider WHEN Locke gets half-turn Item
	
	Sabin					Poison Claws -> Snakebite
							Fire Claws -> Hell Claw
							Meditate -> Sutra
							
	Terra:					Carbunkl to MP+20 / Mag+1
							Zoneseek to MP+20 / Stam+1
							Tritotch to MP+20 / Vig +1
							
	Daryl's					Demonsbane early, Man Eater later?
							
NEXT ON AGENDA

	Fractional Defense:		Damage taken from fractional damage is Power * (160-stam)/128
	
	Bushido:				Flurry and Tempest may randomly crit (spd/512 chance)

	Sketch:					Fail Sketch is only half a turn

	Poison:					Doesn't glitch the screen out when walking
	
	Counter-Attack:			Reverts to 50%. Maybe with some equipment to raise it to 75% (like with spellcast)
							ALTERNATE: Speed-based, but grows MUCH more slowly then current (maybe just 2/3 at 96+ speed or something)

	Slots:					Slot results (and reels?) spaced throughout game better
	
	Heiji's Coin:			Cheats on Cover and Counter
	
	Rage:					Has stam-based chance of coming out of Rage 
								if Moogle Charm is equipped.
							Rage attacks may crit (natural crit rate, boosted by "critical rate up")
							
	Spd-rev-fill			Speed-based pre-fill of ATB after being revived

SOMETIME LATER

	Enemy regen				Can go over 255
	
	Soft Enrage				As xy time passes, ATB builds
	
	Focus Fire				Some foes focus fire squishy player units
	
	AI Script				More scripting space for better "soft enrage" options
	
	WoB Exp Curve			Lower exp gains in IMF
							Raise exp gains in Sealed Cave
	
	Elemental Multipler		x1.5 for Weakness, x2/3 for Resistance
	
	Endgame Equipment:		Less stats
	
	MP						Nerf player's MP game in WoR.
								Raise MP costs?
								Lower base MP amount?
								MP healing is fractional, rather than static?
	
ONE CAN ALWAYS DREAM

	Divergent Paths			Merged into LNW
	
	Divergent Paths, WoR	Three Scenarios 2.0; in the WoR
	
	Mobliz					Life Bell mini-game isn't stupid

UNDEVELOPED IDEAS

	Bro's SOS Idea:			SOS Remedy
							Image
							???
							Sir Newton Fig should like this. Could even change Terra's auto-morph
							pendant to use these instead of auto-haste and auto-regen
							
	Duncan:					Gives Gauntlent effect to physical Blitzes instead of giving Bum Rush
							MY END would be setting Bum Rush to lvl.30 capstone, 210 power
							
	Locke					"Bulwark" to replace Steal/Mug as a lategame relic option
							Checks Cover twice. Relic grants Cover
							
	Healing Shiv			Remove. Have half-turn Item now
							
	?Radiant Gown?:			(temp) re-named to "Artist's Gown"
							Stats changes to Spd/Stam +5
							Resist Water
							--Spellcast rate up (use Veil)
							??MP+ 25%/50% ??
							
	?Healing:?				Alongside the nerfed Cure 2 and Cure 3 power (20 and 30 respectively)
							Raise MP costs to 24 and 48
							Raise RegenX MP cost to 64
