CANNOT RELEASE LOL NEW WORLD WITHOUT THESE

	Tiered Status Evade:	By Status, rather than by enemy
							Breakpoints I believe should be 72, 108, and 128
							72 breakpoint should be "must pass two checks" (hard test)
								
	Morph					MP cost increased by 50% when under Morph

	Locke:					Only Locke may use stealable-only items.
								Slim Jim = Changed to just setting its statuses (Regen & Haste). Brawlers, Soldiers
								Snake Oil = Reduced to 1/4 heal. Merchants, Zozo
								Bio Bomb = Single-targets, sets Blind / Mute / Imp. Late WoB (ghost dudes)
								Bouncy Ball = Steal only. WoR
								Mystery Egg = Consumable, summons Palidor. WoR
							Humanoids only have Locke stealables, and only one Item to steal
								(this one is my end, not yours)
							Steal formula has spd-based chance of success
								

WOULD BE NICE, BUT NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED FOR RELEASE OF LOL NEW WORLD
						
	Back Guard:				Doesn't completely eliminate chances of a back / pincer attack.

	Heiji's Coin:			Cheats on Cover and Counter
	
	Duncan:					Gives Gauntlent effect to physical Blitzes instead of giving Bum Rush
							MY END would be setting Bum Rush to lvl.30 capstone, 210 power
					
	Tools:					Autocrossbow's power is just straight 255, no Schematics
							Something, something, Schematics boosts magic tools
							Schematics hidden ... somewhere

	Slots:					something, something, gains "Schematics" boost somewhere
							Really, just gains more slots later on?

	Rage:					Has stam-based chance of coming out of Rage 
							if Moogle Charm is equipped.
	
	Rage:					Rage may crit
							
	Gau Rage:				Rage attacks may crit (natural crit rate, boosted by "critical rate up")
							
	Retort:					Balanced Retort discussed. Prolly increase Cover/Counter, self-heal, counters with Dispatch?
